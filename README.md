Project Name: TigerWallet

Project Description:
TigerWallet is a personal finance software used to handle all your financial needs and more. TigerWallet will allow users to create monthly budgets, track expenses, view easy to read graphs of their finances, set financial goals, and make transactions with other users of TigerWallet. Utilizing data from a userâ€™s monthly budgets and expenses, TigerWallet helps users meet financial goals by analyzing monthly expenses and spending to make suggestions on areas of spending the user could cut back in order to progress closer to goals set in the software. Upon meeting goals, users will unlock achievements and earn loyalty points. Not only can TigerWallet track and display your finances, but the software also allows for basic peer-to-peer transactions similar to Venmo.
